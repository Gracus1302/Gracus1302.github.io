# OrbitXplorer – Orbital Shuttle Design Project

This repository contains the documentation for the **OrbitXplorer** project, developed as part of a team assignment at **ISAE-SUPAERO (2024)**.  
**OrbitXplorer** is the fictional company created for this project, acting as the prime contractor responsible for designing a **reusable orbital shuttle** dedicated to **debris removal and cargo transportation** in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

## 📄 Content

This folder includes three main reports:

- **Technical Report** → Detailed design of the propulsion system, structure, guidance & control, mission profile, and aerodynamic analyses.  
- **Management Report** → Project organization, timeline, risk assessment, and workload distribution.  
- **Executive Summary** → High-level overview of the mission concept, system objectives, and key design trade-offs.
- **Support com** → Communication flyer 

## 🚀 Overview

The goal of the project was to develop a **modular and partially reusable orbital shuttle**, capable of performing rendezvous, capture, and controlled deorbit of space debris.  
The study combined **mission analysis**, **propulsion modeling**, and **structural design** with management and economic considerations to deliver a realistic pre-design of an operational spacecraft.
